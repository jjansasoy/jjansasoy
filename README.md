# 📌 About me
Hi, I'm Jessica👋

I'm a trained Engineer with a strong programming and data analysis background.

When I moved to Las Vegas I started working not as an engineer but as a casino dealer... yes the ones that deal cards 🎲🃏

(That was fun, but didn't last long)

✍️ After my casino days, I transitioned to freelancing as an SEO Analyst and content writer--writing is one of my many passions. But I kept advancing my expertise in data analysis and programming languages through self-education and certifications.

Right now, I'm eager to excel in a dedicated data analytics role.

# 🗂️ Projects

### [Adidas Sales Data Analysis (SQL) + Visualization (Tableau)](https://github.com/jjansasoy/adidas_sales)

- What is the revenue generated by each product, ranked from highest to lowest?
- What are the top three products in the highest demand in terms of quantity?
- Which retailers have the most sales per state?
- Are there any interesting patterns as to when customers buy more products in terms of seasonality?

# 💡 Skills and Tools

### Tools
Tableau, Power BI, Python, SQL, RStudio, GitHub (obviously), MiniTab, GAMS, Flexsim, and ProModel

### Skills

Critical thinking and problem-solving are my main.

(Yes, I know that those are overly used by people in data-related fields)

But I'm that friend who figures out the optimal pizza slice distribution to satisfy everyone's preferences, even when one friend insists on pineapple and another is a die-hard pepperoni fan🍕🧠

(I also have examples in a more professional field)
